# Hi there!

We, a group of 6 people created this.
The code is pretty bad, but it works, so I'm not going to change it at least for now.

## About the project

We created a website for a local restaurant using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), it's a pretty simple website, but it's
good enough for a small restaurant,
there are a digital menu, and a **AI-powered Chat**, is dumb asf but it's helpful almost all the time.

## Contributing

This project isn't planned to be updated, but if you are interested in the development of this project, feel free to do
a pull request, just don't make the code worse than it already is.

## Some tips

If you are going to use the AI chat thing i personally recommend you to DON'T USE GPT-4, that thing is expensive asf.

DON'T DELETE THE ITEM 0 FROM THE `menu.json` / `menu-mini.json` FILE, IT PREVENTS A WRONG INDEX SINCE ARRAY INDEXES
START AT 0. I mean, it's not hard to fix, but im too lazy to patch that so pls don't delete it.
